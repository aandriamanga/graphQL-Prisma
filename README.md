# graphQL-Prisma

## Getting started

1. Install Prisma globally:
   `npm install -g prisma`

2. If we want to use Prisma localy, we need to have Docker installed on our machine.
   If we don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine).
